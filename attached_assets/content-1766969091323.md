[![BTC](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605123789)BTC+0.27%](https://www.bitget.com/spot/BTCUSDT) [![US](https://www.bitget.com/news/detail/12560605123789)US-0.23%](https://www.bitget.com/spot/USUSDT)

Silver prices surged further to a new all-time high, climbing to a fresh $75.34 record earlier today, Friday, December 26, 2025. This historic milestone marks a remarkable year for the precious metal, which is now up 138% since the beginning of the year. The asset surpassed its previous ATH of $71 mark tested on Tuesday, setting a new record high as it widens the strong rally that enables it to be one of the top-performing global assets this year.

As per numerous market reports, Silver has surged 142% year-to-date, largely outperforming Gold’s 70%’s annual rise. With this breakthrough, Silver overtook Google and Apple to become the world’s third-largest asset by market cap. According to the latest data from Silver is now the third-largest asset globally with a market capitalization of $4.225 trillion, outpacing Apple Inc. and Google, whose market caps currently stand at $4.063 trillion and $3.810 trillion, respectively.

In another important observation, Silver’s 142%-year gain is in contrast with Bitcoin (BTC), commonly recognized as digital gold, which remains down 9.3% on the year, currently posting weak performance among major asset classes. As per CompaniesMarketCap data, Bitcoin is currently the eighth-largest asset in the world with a market cap of $1.769 trillion, following behind Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple.

## What Drives Silver Price?: 3 Catalysts Disclosed

Silver’s move to soar its price to a new unprecedented level happens at the same when Gold and Platinum reached new records today. Gold extended its price growth by climbing to a new record $4,530,60 earlier today, currently trading at $4,520. On the other hand, platinum rose to an ATH of $2,413.62 today.

The three valuable metals surged to new record highs on Friday, December 26, fueled by robust speculative momentum and the anticipation of further Fed interest cuts amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty. An interplay of factors favored the price rise of these precious metals. First, growing geopolitical tensions and uncertainty surrounding the effect of US tariffs on international economic growth have influenced investors towards safe-haven assets such as Gold, Silver, and Platinum.

The second factor is the Fed factor. The US Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the anticipation of further rate decreases are fueling momentum in non-yielding assets like Silver, Platinum, and Gold. The central bank reduced interest rates by 25 bps in September, October, and December this year. There are anticipations of further rate reductions at least twice in 2026, which will weaken the dollar and decrease the opportunity cost of the three precious metals.

The third factor is demand. Platinum, Silver, and Gold are witnessing strong industrial demand while their supply remains tight, developing an environment of scarcity-driven prices. Silver is experiencing huge demand, particularly from sectors, including data centers, semiconductors, solar, and electric vehicles, while Platinum is heavily utilized in automatic catalytic converters. The rising prices of Silver and platinum also reflect a rotation of investment demand from Gold.

## Crypto Market Outlook

The cryptocurrency market’s underperformance is completely different from impressive surges currently being noticed in the Silver, Gold, and Platinum markets. On-chain data indicates that Bitcoin continues its consolidation mood, currently trading at $88,763, after several failed attempts to surge above the $90,000 mark since December 16.

The outstanding performance of Silver, Gold, and Platinum shows that risk-off sentiment is increasing. Historically, whenever uncertainty rises, investors typically channel their funds into traditional safe-haven assets. Gold and Silver have performed that role for hundreds of years.

Increased investment in these precious metals indicates that investors are ready to take on risk. This means that market conditions seem to favor risk-on assets. And soon, selling pressure on Bitcoin will decrease, and renewed demand will begin.
